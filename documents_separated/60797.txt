Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation? 

He was sitting atop a rocket awaiting liftoff and afterwards, in answer to
the question what he had been thinking about, said (approximately) "half a
million components, each has to work perfectly, each supplied by the lowest
bidder....." 

Attribution and correction of the quote would be much appreciated.

I heard a similar statement in our local news (UTAH) tonight. They referred
to the tool as "...the PLIERS that took a ride into space...". They also
said that a Thiokol (sp?) employee had reported missing a tool of some kind
during assembly of one SRB. No more info as to the location in the SRB.
I agree, pretty weird.
