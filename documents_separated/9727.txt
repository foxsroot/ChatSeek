Hi there,

We are running a 120 node Token ring with Windows 3.1 and Novell 3.11.

Every once in a while, we run into "The Black Screen of Death", a phrase
coined by Robert X. Cringely in a recent InfoWorld column.  

Basically, sometimes when you quit Windows, the screen goes black and
you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your
screen.  Also, sometimes when you exit to DOS, the same effect occurs.
Cringely hints that Microsoft and/or Novell has a patch for Windows'
virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  Neither company
seems to know what I am talking about when I call them.

Has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?  

Is there a fix for it?

Any response is welcome.

Subject: Telix problem

When I use telix (or kermit) in WIN 3.1, or use telix after exiting windows
to dos, telix can not find the serial port. If you have some ideas on how
to solve this problem or where I can find further information, send me email
or send it to the news group.  Thanks.
