Hi!  I am in immediate need for details of various graphics compression
techniques.  So if you know where I could obtain descriptions of algo-
rithms or public-domain source codes for such formats as JPEG, GIF, and
fractals, I would be immensely grateful if you could share the info with
me.  This is for a project I am contemplating of doing.

Thanks in advance.  Please reply via e-mail if possible.

Subject: Surface normal orientations

Some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same
direction.  (ie: On a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  You can use
the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making
sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.

How do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a 
set of points, edges and faces?   Say that you had a cube with all faces that 
have their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  What's the
best way to realize that face is "flipped", and should have it's points
re-ordered?   I thought I had a good way of telling this, but then realized
that the algorithm I had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise
order for a 2d polygon.  I'd like something for 3d data.

Any hints, tips, references would be appreciated.

Steve
