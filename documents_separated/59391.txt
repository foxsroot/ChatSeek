Subject: Vasectomy: Health Effects on Women?
From: eskagerb@nermal.santarosa.edu (Eric Skagerberg)

Does anyone know of any studies done on the long-term health effects of a
man's vasectomy on his female partner?

I've seen plenty of study results about vasectomy's effects on men's health,
but what about women? 

For example, might the wife of a vasectomized man become more at risk for,
say, cervical cancer?  Adverse effects from sperm antibodies?  Changes in the
vagina's pH?  Yeast or bacterial infections?

Outside of study results, how about informed speculation?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Dear Bill,
I think you forgot the smileys.  SOME of us got the joke!
