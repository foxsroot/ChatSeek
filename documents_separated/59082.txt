Thanks to aldridge@netcom.com, I now know a bit more about Stargardt's
disease, aka juvenile macular distrophy, but I would like to learn more.

First, what is the general prognosis - is blindness the result?
Second, what treatments, if any, are available?

An apt description of the content of just about all ronroth's posts to
