	The statement above is _true_ to the spirit of the list because
	it is a false statement.  Misinformation: that's the spirit, Bill.

	My /5 will do wheelies because it's a chain drive model.

Sure.  In fact, you can do a wheelie on a shaft-drive motorcycle
without even moving.  Just don't try countersteering.

Hey, what do we look like, a parts store?  Has it ever occurred to you to
visit your dealer and fork out the bucks for a new one?  What are the
chances of someone happening to have a '92 part laying around, much less
one in working condition?  Sheesh, some edu's.  

Besides, I only have the right side inverted GSX-R fork.  It's already been
converted into a floor lamp.
