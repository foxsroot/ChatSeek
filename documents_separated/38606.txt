I have an ATI ultra pro card, and have found that the easiest way to view
true color images is using their windows drivers and something like winjpeg
or photofinish.  

If anyone has a non-windows solution, I'd love to hear it!

I have an ATI Graph. Ultra Pro VLB w/2 megs, and have a small question
about Graphics Workshop for Windows.  When I exit from it it says my
current driver can handle on 32768 colors when I am actually in 
1024x768x65000 color mode.  Is this a driver problem, a GWS error, or
what?  I am using the 1.5(59) driver under Win 3.1.  It correctly
states that I can display 16M colors when I switch to 800x600x24bit,
though.
Another question- Anybody know of any Viewers that support this card
other than Windows viewers?
Any help would be appreciated.
