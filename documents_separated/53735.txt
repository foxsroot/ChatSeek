From: mora@verdi.cineca.it (Stefano Mora)

Hi,
I've got a PACE MODEM , Series Four 2400s ( made in England by
PACE Micro Technology ) with a broken power supply .
So I'd like to know :

- the voltage and current values of the original 
  power supply PS1001.
- the pinout of the power supply connector.
- the pinout of the USER PORT and how to use it.

Many thanks in advance to all the people help me.
Please post the reply also to my e-mail..........

Subject: Telephone Controlled Power Bar Needed

I would appreciate some help in locating a telephone controlled power bar
for my PC. The unit would power up the PC when the telephone rings and
keep it up as long as the telephone connection is present.

I also need to be able to power up this same PC through the use of an external
timer. I can supply power or a contact closure to do this.

I will summarize and post the results of this query here.

Thank you.
