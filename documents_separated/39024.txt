Subject: GIF TO TARGA
From: david.mason@channel1.com (David Mason)

Krzysztof Muchorowski was asking about GIF-to-TGA conversion so that he
could use DTA 1.5 to convert the TGA files to FLI animation files.

Krzysztof, update your copy of DTA to a more recent release (the current
is 1.8g).  Later versions of DTA can read GIF files.

Subject: Universal VESA Driver

        Some time ago (about 1 month) there was a bit of discussion
        about a universal VESA driver for > 8bit cards.  It was in
        the file uvesa32.zip.  Well i can't find it, does anyone know
        where it is (gorilla.something.something.au), and what sort
        of cards it works for ?

        Also would it be pushing my luck to ask for someone to post
        it to some appropriate group.
