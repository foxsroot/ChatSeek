Sure, I can. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Motorcycles, edited by Erwin 
Tragatsch, was published by The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited, 
Astronaut House, Hounslow Road, Feltham, Middlesex, England.

It was first published in 1977, and mine was reprinted in 1978. Cost then 
was Pounds 5.95 in the UK, though I paid 18.50 for it in Canadian 
dollars. I have no idea whether it's still in print. Perhaps you could 
let the net know.

	I've already discussed this in e-mail with Jonathan.  It's the film
"The Inspector General"  [:-)], with Danny Kaye, although I can't quote the
name of the leading lady (Because Maltin doesn't :-().  Jonathan thinks there
was an earlier Russian film; "Movies on TV" just says it was based on a Gogol
(Yes, Jonathan, I looked it up again -- only two o's) story.
