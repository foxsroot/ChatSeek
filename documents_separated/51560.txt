No, he's not missing anything.  You're right that some models of the 650 ship in
the USA without FPU or Ethernet.  Per Ejeklint is also right -- *all*, I repeat,
*ALL* Centris 650's sold here in New Zealand and, I assume, Europe have the FPU
and Ethernet.

I know.  I bought a 650 4/80 and it has both FPU and Ethernet.

Subject: Re: iisi clock upgrades

I've just completed a successful upgrade of a an SI to 27.5 mhz. I'm waiting
on delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. Definitely needed the
heatsink. The CPU was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until I glued
on a 90 cent Radio Shack sink. 

I made a call for reports of failures last week. No reports have arrived
here. Locally, in Seattle there is a reported CPU damage due to the user
slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly
a problem due to the CPU running too fast.

I think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system
configurations including PDS and Nubus cards which were used. I'd be happy
to coordinate and report results
