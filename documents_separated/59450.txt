I am currently in the throes of a hay fever attack.  SO who certainly
never reads Usenet, let alone Sci.med, said quite spontaneously "
There are a lot of mushrooms and toadstools out on the lawn at the
moment.  Sure that's not your problem?"

Well, who knows?  Or maybe it's the sourdough bread I bake?

After reading learned, semi-learned, possibly ignorant and downright
ludicrous stuff in this thread, I am about ready to believe anything :-)

If the hayfever gets any worse, maybe I will cook those toadstools...

Go to your public library and get the February, 1988 issue of Consumer
Reports.  An article on allergy shots begins on page 96.  This article
is MUST reading for anyone contemplating allergy shots.
