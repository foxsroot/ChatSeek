Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  The
final diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.
(Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a
military dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments
as part of its regular health care.)  I am hoping that the arrival of (1)
Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY*
she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it
seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(

Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for
spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.

Thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.

It's got potential.  Instead of *.chemistry, how about splitting the
classification into *.biochemistry (which are probably the topics
you're thinking of) and *.pharmaceutical (which otherwise might end up
in *.(bio)chemistry)?

(This is separate from the issue of whether there is sufficient potential
news volume to support either or both groups.)

I'll add 'em to my medical/health newsgroup wish list (which I'm looking
forward to posting and discussing -- but not for another 10 days or so).
