From: <N51BC@CUNYVM.BITNET>

Everyone seems to think that this man's mouse problem is mechanical (its dirty)
 I have been having a similar problem with my mouse, and it only occurs when ru
nning windows and therefore cannot be mechanical in nature. I'm running a mouse
 systems compatible mouse on a 486 66 DX2 with a trident 1 meg video card and a
m experienceing similar jumpiness as well as strange font subsitutions and mous
e traces left on screen and windows gpf errors. HELP!!!

This may work, but won't it involve invoking the applications, e.g. if you
drag a .bmp or .txt file to the min. Print Manager icon, won't it RUN
Notepad and Paintbrush before printing?  If you just want to drag a file
(.txt or .bmp) to a print server icon, with stay at front attributes, you
need an intelligent Print Manager drag and drop client like Amish Print 2.0.
