Subject: "STAR GARTDS" <sp?> Info wanted
From: kmcvay@oneb.almanac.bc.ca (Ken Mcvay)

A friend's daughter has been diagnosed with an eye disease called "Star
Gartds" (or something close) - it is apparently genetic, according to her,
and affects every fourth generation.

She would appreciate any information about this condition. If anything is
available via ftp, please point me in the right direction..

Infantile spasms have been well understood for quite some time now.  You
are seeing a pediatric neurologist, aren't you?  If not, I strongly
recommend it.  There is a new anticonvulsant about to be released called
felbamate which may be particularly helpful for infantile spasms.  As
for learning more about seizures, ask your doctor or his nurse about a
local support group.
