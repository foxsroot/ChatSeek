	How about some citations or is this just impressionistic speculation

 For 30 years I've been laboring under the delusion that chain drives

	No flames, please!  I've got both kinds of drives.

I think you have the choke (starter) jet blocked and even the idle one.

Subject: 1st time Biker iso ADVICE


I'm just starting out with motorcycles,  I've read up on the subject a bit,
talked to many of my friends who own/ride bikes and encourage me to do the
same.  But when I ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at... i get
varied answers.


I'm 6'3", about 230#, large/athletic build...  I suppose that would help to
determine the size bike i'd want.  I want something that's going to be fast and
powerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once i'm used to it.  I also want
something that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out.  Any ideas?!
