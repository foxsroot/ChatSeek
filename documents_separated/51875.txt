Subject: Word Printing to IIg
From: gary@marshall.wvnet.edu (gary's news)

We have a user that has Word 5.0 and is using symbols such as pi and
other mathematic sysmbols, plus doing fractions, etc.

The document shows up on the screen with no problems, looks fine.

When she tries to print it on a IIg the pi changes to an upside down
caret, and several other symbols change to double quotes at bottom of
character, plus some little circles appear between words of the fractions
instead of spaces.

This happens on a IIg laser printer.  Tried it on serveral macs and two
different IIg's.

Prints fine on an NT and NTX laser printers.

What's wrong???

Thanks for any help in advance,

Gary

Subject: Re: Quadra 700 Sound



	The Quadra 700 goes thru extensive initalize routines of its hardware,
read's PRAM, obtains all info from last session including the volume
setting, and then executes the sound procedure for the startup sound, and
wait's on the SCSI controller to respond to the boot up code.


If the DRAM produces an error, or a registers cannot be read from a device,
or the device corrupts that address/data or control paths, then if it is
possible, the firmware branchs to another sound routine that produces the 
'sad mac' sound.


This is a general breifing of the start up procedure of a typical mac.
If you cannot control the volume of the quadra, even at boot up, then i feel
there is something incorrect with the logic board. 

My Quadra 700 does not show the problems you are having.
