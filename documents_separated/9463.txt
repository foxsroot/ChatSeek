I've been using version 2.5.2 of ghostscript, and I'm quite satisfied
with it.  There are, actually, 3 versions:  a plain dos version, a 386
version, and a windows version.

There's a package called Workspace on cica that has 5 desktops; I
haven't done much with it yet, but it seems to be able to do what you
want it to.

Don't have the exact archive name handy, but it's something like
wspace<blah>.zip.
