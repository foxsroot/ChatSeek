Subject: GUI builders for VMS
From: mark@trident.datasys.swri.edu (Mark D. Collier)

I am looking for GUI Builders/UIMS's which run in a VMS/OpenVMS
environment. I am interested in both Motif tools and GUI-independent
tools such as XVT. My client also requires that the tool has been
in production for at least 6 months in the VMS environment. Note
that I have the list of tools from the FAQ, but not the info on
VMS availability.

Thanks

Subject: xnlock / xdm

I am using xnlock as the screensaver for a PC-based X server. However,
after an interval of no activity, my X session ends. This does not
happen when I use xscreensaver. 

My screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this:

xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 &

My hypothesis is that xdm (I use xdmcp to start my X session) detects
a period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session.
However, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. Is
there a workaround?

I'd prefer responses via e-mail.

Thanks.
