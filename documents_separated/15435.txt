No wonder American businesses are going down the tubes! :-|

(It's NIST, not NSA.  NSA is not supposed to have anything to do with this.)
They didn't say that.  They said is was better than some commercial-grade
encryptions.  I, for one, wouldn't trust them if they did, unless they
release the algorithm for investigation.

Maybe the ACLU and EFF.  (It would have to be a non-profit, so the big 8
would be out.)

I wouldn't trust the NSA.  I think I would trust the President on this, but
I'm not certain he would be told.

That's your problem.

I want to emphasize the I am not speaking for Beckman Instruments at this
point.  However, we are an international company, and I would like to think
that our customers come first, ahead of our government's whims.

It always amazes me how quick people are to blame whatever
administration is current for things they couldn't possibly have
initiated.  This chip had to take *years* to develop, yet already
we're claiming that the Clinton administration sneaked it in on us.
Bullshit.  The *Bush* administration and the career Gestapo were
responsible for this horror, and the careerists presented it to the
new presidency as a fait accompli.  That doesn't excuse Clinton and
Gore from criticism for being so stupid as to go for it, but let's lay
the body at the proper door to start with.
