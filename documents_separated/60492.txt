I know this isn't the EXACT right place to put this, but im desperate!

I'll be going home for the summer, and wont have direct access to my
VAX account....My problem is, i need a service that doesn't charge body
parts, vital organs, or my first born son, that allows me access to the
internet!  All i really need is to be able to TELNET to my school account,
and from there I can do anything I need to do.   ANY HELP WILL BE GREATLY
APPRECIATED!!!!!!!!!!!

Please! E-MAIL to DFMORGAN@acs.harding.edu

 Computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to
 leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're 
 putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.
  Imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.
 You're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,
 etc on all the components of your computer. So you may save
 a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't
 look like much when it come time to fix your computer.
