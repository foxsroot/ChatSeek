	I swore off taking passengers over ten years ago, but I recall
 Sturgis, 1981 getting some strange looks because my passenger
 was reading a book.  She was so engrossed that she didn't even
 notice when we hit a roadkill to make the hit-of-the-day
 with the riders behind us.

Can anyone recommend a good place for reasonably priced bike paint jobs, preferably but not essentially in the London area. 

Thanks
