Shareware is available from the net, magazines, distributors, clubs,
friends, and bulletin boards. I don't think people have any problems
getting hold of it.

Fill gaps in Dos? There's no need for many people - Dos 5 provides
more services than I need as it is. I just run Windows on top of it.

BTW, my Windows must be an operating system - it provides a Disk
Operating System that Dos can't access. (NFS...) :-)

[ Lots of stuff deleted because I felt like it ]

This MS bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.

I think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of MS products do not even know about internet, and Unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know. And the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors. While PC users tend to
customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their 
command line.

So to most of the computer users in the world MS product symbolize
quality. MS has made their life easier, and more productive and to them
that is quality. They do not care about what innovative things MS has
done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier. You may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception.

Face it until Unix come up with a decent GUI that is available to
all variations of Unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users. We here on the net are not mainstream computer users.
