So why not condemn the Mufti for his Nazi leanings, and condemn all his
supporters, while also condemning the similarly genocidal killing of
innocents, Muslim or not, in Bosnoia-Herzegovina? Hatred and bigotry
remain just that, no matter who practices them.

If Croats are now divided, it is because Croatia seceded from Yugoslavia.
Croats in Croatia, B-H, and Serbia were in *one* country--Yugoslavia--
until they divided themselves. 

If Muslims are now divided, it is because B-H seceded from Yugoslavia.
Muslims in Croatia, B-H, and Serbia were in *one* country--Yugoslavia--
until they divided themselves.

That Croats and Muslims in Yugoslavia decided to divide themselves does
*not* give them the right to divide Serbs in Yugoslavia.

Croatia and B-H shoulder the burden for dividing their own nations among
various unstable countries.
