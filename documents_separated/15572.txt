Subject: Looking for MS-DOS crypto programs
From: EXTDSM@LURE.LATROBE.EDU.AU (MADDISON,David)

I am a new reader of sci.crypt I would like to obtain a copy of a
public domain program that can encrypt files, preferably using DES,
that runs under MS-DOS.

I would also like to obtain a program which will password protect
floppy disks, if this is possible.

Thanks.

I thought I would note that except Lenstra's packages, none of the
large-integer packages are in the public domain. As an alternative,
a straightforward *PD* implementation of Knuth's algorithms may be
found as a part of Uof Arizona's ICON distribution.
