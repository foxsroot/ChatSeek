AT&T also puts out two new products for windows, Model numbers elude me now,
a 15 bit video board with framegrabber and a 16bit with same. Yesterday I
was looking at a product at a local Software ETC store. Media Vision makes
a 15bit (32,768 color) frame capture board that is stand alone and doesnot
use the feature connector on your existing video card. It claims upto 30 fps
live capture as well as single frame from either composite NTSC or s-video
in and out.

Subject: stand alone editing suite.

I need some help.  We are upgrading our animation/video editing stand. We
are looking into the different type of setups for A/B roll and a cuts only
station.  We would like this to be controlled by a computer ( brand doesnt matter but maybe MAC, or AMIGA).  Low end to high end system setups would be very
helpful. If you have a system or use a system that might be of use, could you
mail me your system requirements, what it is used for, and all the hardware and
software that will be necessary to set the system up.  If you need more 
info, you  can mail me at   eylerken@u.washington.edu

thanks in advance.
