Subject: XV under MS-DOS ?!?
From: NO E-MAIL ADDRESS@eicn.etna.ch

Hi ... Recently I found XV for MS-DOS in a subdirectory of GNU-CC (GNUISH). I 
use frequently XV on a Sun Spark Station 1 and I never had problems, but when I
start it on my computer with -h option, it display the help menu and when I
start it with a GIF-File my Hard disk turns 2 or 3 seconds and the prompt come
back.

My computer is a little 386/25 with copro, 4 Mega rams, Tseng 4000 (1M) running
MS-DOS 5.0 with HIMEM.SYS and no EMM386.SYS. I had the GO32.EXE too... but no
driver who run with it.

Do somenone know the solution to run XV ??? any help would be apprecied..
		
	Thanx in advance !!!!

Subject: Need polygon splitting algo...


The idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not
necessarily rectangular) as a window.  My problem then is in
finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons"
from the first one.  Is this simply a matter of extending the
usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked
against another polygon???  Is there a simpler way??

Comments welcome.

Noel.
