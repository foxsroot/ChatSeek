Be very careful with these results!  As I recall, numbers from Winbench
2.5 are calculated differently from 3.1, and so these figures are not
comparable.

However, to answer Stephen's question, replacing the Ahead B card with
a Diamond 24x will yield a cost-effective, dramatic speed increase for
Windows.  That or the ATI Graphics Ultra Plus....

And why they are considering using WinBench as a test, they may want
to read everything Steve Gibson has said on the subject in his
InfoWorld column the past couple of month.  In short, virtually
every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the
driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the
WinBench suite.  So the WinBench score has no bearing in reality to
how cards stack up on real world tasks.

In the last PC-Magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators,
and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on WinBench.  Interestingly,
they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt
operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other
types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  At least
one card was eliminated from the "Editor's Choice" because of
cheating on the benchmark.
