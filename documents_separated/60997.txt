Subject: Life on Mars???
From: schiewer@pa881a.inland.com (Don Schiewer)

What is the deal with life on Mars?  I save the "face" and heard 
associated theories. (which sound thin to me)

Are we going back to Mars to look at this face agian?
Does anyone buy all the life theories?

Why would you want to do that? The goal is to do it cheaper (remember,
this isn't government). Instead of leasing an expensive launch pad,
just use a SSTO and launch from a much cheaper facility.
