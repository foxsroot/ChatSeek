Subject: PC BOARD Layout Help
From: <EH1QC@CUNYVM.BITNET>

Hi,  I have a few questions about laying out a PCB. I am using easytrax for dos
which is a great program. But what my question is When laying out traces what
thickness should they be? I am mainly designing low voltage low current boards
for micro controller apps. What should pad sizes be for resistors? I will be
turning to a commercial PCB maker to produce 1's of these boards and I was
wondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other. Well
any info would be great. Thanks.

 Pink Noise and White Noise are equal amounts of all frequencies.  This
is in most cases around the 20-3.3K Hz range.  Pink/White are used to
adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that.  There are a few EQ's out
on the market that have Pink noise built in.  Most all from Audio
Control have them I know the C-101 does.
