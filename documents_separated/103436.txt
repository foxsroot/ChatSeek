Actually, I've had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage
junk mail in along with whatever else into *anybody's* prepaid envelopes
until they almost burst.  I believe they pay postage by weight.
heh, heh, heh...

Anyways, don't tear up the quotes just yet...I sometimes use their
quotes or other insurance quotations as leverage to haggle for a
lower rate elsewhere.  Usually it works to *your* advantage if 
they are lower.

The DeLorean had the yucky PRV V6 engine. A joint-venture between Peugout (note 
spelling), Renault and Volvo. PRV. This engine is a *MIGHTY BORING* piece of
junk with approx 140hp. Doesn't like revs at all.

If you look at the DeLorean in the movie Back To the Future you will note
that they changed the engine sound to a big V8. A real DeLorean doesn't sounds
half as good. You will also note that every time they have to spin the tires
in the movie the ground is all wet. This is because a DeLorean can't make
a burnout on a dry road! The weak engine thats mounted over the rear axle
makes it almost impossible.
