I'd like to converse with anyone who has purchased a 1993 Honda
Civic about their experience.  I'm new to the car buying game
and would like to know what price I can expect to pay for a sedan
after bargaining.

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Heard of these South Bay shops?

I need to bring on my VW Corrado for body work (I got hit). I was
wondering if anyone has heard of any of these South Bay body shops:

Akins Collision Center of Santa Clara - on Reed St
Auto West Collision - in San Jose
Los Gatos Acura
Royal Auto Body - in Sunnyvale

Thanks!
