as someone who just lived through a switch from SunOS4.x.x. to
Solaris, i'll heartily agree with this. 

ObCrypt: one of my main gripes with Solaris is its braindead mailx,
which is -almost- enough like mail to get you hoping, but crashes
horribly when you try to do anything useful with it. (like use pgp-
capable sendmail replacements.)

Can we use murder instead of copyright violation, just to keep things
straight?  The 5th applies only to criminal cases which copyright 
infringements are not (they are civil).

P.S. I'm sorry to waste bandwidth on a quibble, I just don't want
anyone to get confused.  I think a bunch of kiddie porn GIFs make
a better test case than a bunch of Peanuts strips and that IS criminal
both in posession and distribution.
