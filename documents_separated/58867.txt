From: keith@actrix.gen.nz (Keith Stewart)

My wife has become interested through an acquaintance in Post-Polio Syndrome
This apparently is not recognised in New Zealand and different symptons ( eg
chest complaints) are treated separately. Does anone have any information on
it

Thanks

Believe what you will.

The mass of anectdotal evidence, combined with the lack of
a properly constructed scientific experiment disproving
the hypothesis, makes the MSG reaction hypothesis the
most likely explanation for events.
