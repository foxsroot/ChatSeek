Subject: HELP: is my monitor dying???
From: edwin@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Edwin Ng)

Hi.  Recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about
3 minutes to warm up.  

Previously, when I first start up my PC I can see all the 
CMOS messages (RAM test ...etc) but now I've got to wait 
for about 3min before the display shows anything and
it starts up with a bright white flash.  This only happens
when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).
If it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
again, the display works as normal like before.

Does anyone know what is causing this?  Is it a warning that
it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a
386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  I've used systems at work for
years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.

I'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer.
Thanks a lot.

Edwin

You'll probably get one when you realize that your $100 vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...

>If anything, SCSI (on a PC) will be obsolete-> killed off by Vesa Local
With any luck PC bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.

Have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus.  It actually  slows down your system

Maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus
IDE is

Vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi? whatever intels spec is.
VLBUS it not good for much more than vga cards.

To each his own.  I'll laugh when you start crying over how much you
spent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more
space.

don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know
nothing about.


I'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.
(obviously exaggerated).

Have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  Oh I forgot you can't
because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

I guess you probably bought a 486sx too

What?  The SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap....

Stop this thread now, Its just cluttering up bandwidth.  If you want
to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.

the best SCSI-2 FAST,WIDE,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.
All the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2
drives.  You can't judge such completely different interfaces.  
IDE has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance.
SCSI has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.

neither one is better in all cases.

If you don't belive what I said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of PC-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa
busmastering cards.

send flames to /dev/null.....
