The problem is that this will also cause  "a certain amount of interference"
in *all* systems within the range of the device.  A long time ago I built a
small jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at 
something like 4am, which had just enough range to cover my room and his.
However something powerful enough to mask all (or at least most) emissions from
your computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods
radio and TV reception.  This isn't going to make you many friends.

Incidentally, an older-model TRS80 makes a fine wideband jammer <grin>

The paper was distributed (against the wishes of the NSA - I have a copy
with a few 'illicit distribution' footnotes scribbled on it :-), and eventually
published at one of the crypto conferences.  Things were looking good.

Then Xerox patented the algorithms.  <Plonk!>

I don't know of anything which uses them.  Also, Khafre was broken at a
later conference and from work on a related algorithm I don't think the
existing Khufu would hold up too well against a converted differential
cryptanalysis attack, although it can probably be changed to resist this
type of attack....

   It's not Clipper, it's any encryption system.  I've seen a number of
   designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.

Depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same
key, it can be done.  For example, I was using "vat", which is an
Internet Audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the
session.  (Unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't
have the CPU for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different
site)

So, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge.  But if
you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
conversation....
