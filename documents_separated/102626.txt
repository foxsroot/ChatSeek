Bob, I think that Stark does this sort of thing as a joke, not as a
serious prediction.  I don't really see why we should shoot him for
that.  The guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming

indicates that they aren't joking and actually believe it.

Wow.  ESPN can repeat eleven-year-old Bill James research.  (Literally.
Check the 1982 Abstract.)

Perhaps in 2004 they'll be as reliable as an average SDCN.

Oops, maybe not.
