Can somebody point out to me where I can find the specs for .GL and .FLI files

Check out Image Pals v1.2 from U-Lead (until May, special $99 intro price,
310-523-9393). It has the basic image processing tools for all major formats,
does screen grabbing, and allows all your image files to be calalogged into
a thumbnail database. It's great!
