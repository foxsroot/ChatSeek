Methinks you recall wrong. Mitchell hit close to .300 in Atlanta and 
continued to walk alot after his promotion. He was then (I think) left
off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
even the Braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
at going back down. 

he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the Braves blamed part of it
on the demotion. I'd much rather have Mitchell than say Mark Whiten on
the Cards.

After the marvelous "time-out" call by Chris Webber (which resulted in 
a technical foul, since his team had no time-outs left) perhaps Webber 
will take the place of Bill Buckner as the master of choke.  At least 
this Red Sox fan hopes so.

REALLY???  My little mind be boggled!  I don't have a 1993 Rule Book
yet, so David, would you please post the new wording of Rule 1.01 -- I
am MIGHTILY curious!  Much thanks.
