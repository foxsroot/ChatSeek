If you are managing PC's on a Novell network, get the network management
tools provided by either Sabre Software or Automated Design Systems. 
Among the many features, you'll find utilities that can help you to
manage .INI files stored on users' workstations or home directories. 
This is commercial software and well worth the money.  To date, I have
not found ANYTHING available via FTP that could compare.  Reply to the
address in my .SIG for more info.

Subject: speeding up windows

I have a 386/33 with 8 megs of memory

I have noticed that lately when I use programs like WpfW or Corel Draw
my computer "boggs" down and becomes really sluggish!

What can I do to increase performance?  What should I turn on or off

Will not loading wallpapers or stuff like that help when it comes to
the running speed of windows and the programs that run under it?

Thanx in advance

Derek
