Subject: Postscript File Viewer?
From: bmartin@bbs.ug.eds.com

A co-worker of mine needs to convert a postscript file to a form readable
(ie ascii) in windows or DOS. Does anybody know of a utility that will do
this? I have a vague memory of a shareware utility someone mentioned once...

Thanks for any info,

Barry.

  I'm looking for a c.itoh printer driver for Windows 3.1.  Does anybody
happen to know where I could find such a beast?

  Thanks in advance,
