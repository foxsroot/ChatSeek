I haven't been able to open an ftp session with that machine.

Operating under the assumption that the address was wrong, I tried using
nslookup and nicname/whois...

[nnsc.nsf.net]
Host or domain name            Internet address

 ncsl                           server = mail-gw.ncsl.nist.gov         
 mail-gw.ncsl                   129.6.48.199
 ncsl                           server = dove.nist.gov                 
 ncsl                           server = ecf.ncsl.nist.gov             
 ecf.ncsl                       129.6.48.2
 ncsl                           server = enh.nist.gov                  
 ncsl                           server = SUNMGR.NCSL.NIST.GOV          
 SUNMGR.NCSL                    129.6.48.12
[...]

That's all I could find about the ncsl domain...oh, and I tried an MX lookup
on the machine in question, which failed.  Nicname/whois domain lookups at
both registries failed, too. 

So I thought, "hey, I'm just not using the tools right" and tried calling
the BBS number -- no answer.

I'm probably doing something wrong...or, perhaps, the machine has been put
behind a firewall.  But it does look like csrc.ncsl.nist.gov has become an
un-machine.  If someone would try ftp'ing to it, or knows what's up, I'd
really appreciate the info.

        A 'multi-line cleartext bridge?"
                      ^^^^^^^^^
        And just were would you put that bridge?  If it isn't at one of
the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  You have blown any
security you thought you might have had.
