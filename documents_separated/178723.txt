Atomic Energy Commision - Hmm, they would say this.

The Earth may spew alot of substances into the atmosphere, but the quality 
of your toxic output can easily make up for the lack of quantity.  Furthermore, 
the planet is a system of carbon, sulfur and other chemicals which have been
acting for billions of years, we are but newcomers to the system - we must adapt
and control in order to bring about stability.  Also, two wrongs do not make a right, 
so continuing our practices despite overwhelming data is just ignorance in (non)action.

Educated and open minded environmentalists do not.

Good point, Brett.  It might merely be proof that basic health care
markets operate differently, with certain nonmarket phenomenom that
the private sector can't handle well (like armies vs. warlords). In
that respect, the effects on American society vs. Canadian/European
society might also be different.

Good point again.  Blue Cross in the U.S. is quite convoluted compared
to the Canadian and German insurance funds, which have a minimal
organization to coordinate it.  If anything, bureaucracy now needs to
be built up in Canada to combat fraud, such as Americans crossing the
border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and
relatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing
them in blocks.  Our private practices are now recording insurance
account numbers, both public insurance and private insurance, which
most have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour 
system.
