Yeah, but I hate to follow them with the exhaust at ground level. Not all
diesels are well maintained, either, it seems they run for so long that
people keep them going long after the top end is worn out.

Subject: service indicator of a BMW


Does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a BMW after changing
the oil yourself?

Also, I have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five
yellow service indicators went out. That means I don't need oil service until
it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. Any idea?

PS of cause I did my first oil change at 1,200 miles
