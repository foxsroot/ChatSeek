Subject: [rw] Is Robert Weiss the only orthodox Christian?

  Robert, you keep making references to "orthodox" belief, and saying things
like "it is held that..." (cf. "Kermit" thread).  On what exact body of
theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?"  Who is that "holds
that" Luke meant what you said he meant?  Whenever your personal interpretation
of Biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems
to be that one needs merely to "look at the Bible" in order to see the truth,
but what of those who see Biblical things differently from you?  Are we to
simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it?
  Just curious,

No.  I also understand it. I have read the Bible from cover to cover, examining
each book within, cross-comparing them, etc.  And I have come to same conclusions
as Robert Weiss.

So Rick, why not read the Bible for yourself?  It is written in plain
english.  Decide for yourself.
