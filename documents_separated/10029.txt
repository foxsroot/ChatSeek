Subject: Boot-up sometimes fails.
From: cs416530@lux.latrobe.edu.au (Matthew I Gillard)

Sometimes when I boot up windows 3.1, after the windows logo comes up it han
gs, I am using Dos 6 and doublespace, and a 5 meg temp swap file on an
uncompressed drive.
But when I press the reset button on the computer,  windows boots up
fine... Why is this??? is it dos 6?

Try the windows multimedia development kit, it has most of the file formats defined
