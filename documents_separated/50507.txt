Subject: ** Need Advice ** (about Tech Works etc.)
From: choo@ecs.umass.edu



Greetings!!

	I planning to upgrade my Mac IIsi:

		(1) from the present 5Megs to 17Megs;
	and	(2) add a Math-Coprocessor.

	Technology Works, of Austin (Texas) comes quite highly recommended by 
some Mac magazines.  I was just wonderring if anyone could share with me 
anything about Tech Works (both good and bad experiences); or give any advice
about other mail-order companies that I may consider.

	Your reply would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance.

Sincerely
Peter Choo

Subject: Duo Dock problems

Has anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duo
properly?

When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of inches
when ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I've
had the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have to
grab hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, or
do I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weeks
while I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy or
SCSI etc. 

(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn't
want to slide out any more).
