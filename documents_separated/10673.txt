Hello All!

    It is my understanding that all True-Type fonts in Windows are loaded in
prior to starting Windows - this makes getting into Windows quite slow if you
have hundreds of them as I do.  First off, am I correct in this thinking -
secondly, if that is the case - can you get Windows to ignore them on boot and
maybe make something like a PIF file to load them only when you enter the
applications that need fonts?  Any ideas?

Ignore the attacks and look at the sales numbers and the MS
stock price if you need some 
gratification. Just keep doing the great job you have done in the past.
