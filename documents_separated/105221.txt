Shaft: Bamboozle, beat, beguile, burn (or flame), deceive, hoax,
       hoodwink.

Drive: Campaign, crusade, push.

So, 'shaft drive' may be a campaign to decieve or a crusade of beguile,
efforts where are true to the spirit of this list.

Wheel: revolution, swing

Crusaders of beguile are innefective in revolutions and they cannot
swing, either, therefore shaft drives cannot do wheelies.

So, hey, like, does this work the other way? If I was to like, you
know, strap a generator to my FZJRR11000KRX and route its output to
the chain, could I increase the horsepower? 32 meters a sec is
pretty nice and all, but, I'd still like to be able to blow away 
a Goldwing without going to nitro...
