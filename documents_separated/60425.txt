From: schauf@iastate.edu (Brian J Schaufenbuel)



I am looking at buying some Companion brand VLB/ISA/EISA motherboards with
HINT chipsets.  Has anybody had any experience with this board (good or bad)?
Any information would be helpful!

thanks

Subject: How to detect mouse at hardware level?


'lo all,

  I am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration.
It's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
network.  (Actually, it already is running, it's just not getting all
the info I want it to yet...)  Anyway, I want to check for a mouse.  I
already check for a mouse driver (using the code in Microsoft's Mouse
book).  But there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
program runs, or that they ever load the driver.

  Since I am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
do I detect is a mouse is attached?  I know it can be done because the
mouse driver can do it.

  Thanks in advance,

Andy
