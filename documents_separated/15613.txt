Imagine if this were available during the 1992 elections; instead of
clumsily searching through the Clinton passport file, they could have 
just done a "voice-grep" (as someone stated earlier) on his telephone
conversations for the last 10 years.

I'm not a lawyer and I don't even play one on TV, but intuitively there's
something wrong with having one's words archived for possible future
use against you.  This possibility frightens me more than any of the
talk about the Clipper Chip, right to cryptography, etc.

I'm afraid it just might.

	The Clipper standard *is* the first step toward outlawing other
strong encryption standards.  If the government didn't intend to outlaw
other forms of encryption, than Clipper is just a big waste of time and money.
Why, you ask?  Because anyone who is transferring data that any government
agency could use against him/her would be a total fool to use the Clipper
system..So why add the backdoor-key if all lawbreakers will use alternate
encryption methods? Because they assume they can just do away with everything
else.
	I, for one, am planning on boycotting any equipment that contains
clipper technology.
