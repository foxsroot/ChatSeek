I don't think they can do that without changing the law.  The chip itself
isn't classified, and reverse engineering is allowed by law (possibly)
unless prohibited by a valid contract.  The algorithm may be classified,
but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information, but obtained from unclassified sources, is freely
publishable (with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information.)

Yes -- great chapter.  Elizabeth Friedman (sp?) comes shining through.

However, the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own
crypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact.  (How's that for a revolving
door?)

Now, given that today's rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more
money than yesterday's, it's reasonable to expect them to have even better
cryptography.  I doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet, but ....

So, my question of the FBI/NIST/NSA is: "How are you going to make the rum
runners use the Clipper Chip?"

Answer:  	you're not.

Question:	OK -- in that case, your justification for taking away our
		rights has evaporated.  How do you justify our loss of rights
		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists?
