Subject: What about SMARTDRV /DOUBLE_BUFFER?
From: psweeney@miavx1.acs.muohio.edu

I am curious:  what does the /double_buffer parameter in smartdrv actually do
for me?  I seem to have less problems in Windows when I leave it out.

Using a PS/2 with an ESDI drive, but also a PS/2 with a SCSI.

Any response is welcome.

Subject: WINHELP.EXE virus?


Is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the WINHELP.EXE file?

I have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran
Norton AntiVirus for WINDOWS.  It indicated a possible unknown
virus in the WINHELP.EXE file in both the MWINDOWS and WINOS2
directories.  Neither file changed since I installed my OS/2
system in January as far as I know.

Any information about this possible virus and suggestions on
remedies would be greatly appreciated.
