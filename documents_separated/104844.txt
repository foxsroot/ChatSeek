	Yep! I did one yesterday on my shaftie Vision... I should mention  
that I had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over :-) . The wheelie was  
the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an  
intersection (damn San Antonio cagers tend to be REALLY bad drivers).  

	However, I have done one by myself, it just takes a lot of  
pre-clutch dump rev action.

	just a passing comment

One of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on
his megabuck/micromass bike. He said he once repelled a dog attack by
picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
head with the rear wheel. The dog had _no_ idea what hit him, and he
fled quite rapidly. Then again, he could jump garbage cans without a
ramp, so I don't think I'd care to try this one on a motorcycle.

That's almost unfair, I've never seen a dog that could use a phone. :-)
