Enter 1st, wait 2-3 seconds and then go into reverse.  They use the same
synchros, and you'll never (at least I haven't) ground-em-to-fit when using
this technique.

Try Eagle GAs, wear better, cost less, lose little handling, and are
quieter.  I'm going to switch to 225s in my next set, with new rims
(Fitti Twists) if I can afford 'em by the time my GAs wear out.

Mine is strong enough to not let the car move when it's in, even if you're
giving it enough gas to normally move it in 1st.  You might need a brake
adjustment.

Watch it closely, the glass actually flexes from the torque in the motor, it
seems stronger in the drivers window then the others.

GK>I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The

I've found the location (under the armrest in between the seats) to be a
pain, but like having them.  They moved it into the dash (pop out) in the
'91 model year, MUCH better.

GK>I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't

I did the same thing.  Got a black '89 with 65.5k miles on it for $8k
in July '92.

Grabbed it and archived it.  Thanks!

GK>If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up!

I'll be starting one this summer, one way or the other (current software
I use dosen't support mailing lists, but is on the RSN list - if not, I'm
going to upgrade to another package that DOES have it), that is, if nobody
else beats me to it.  Will make an announcement here when it goes up.

The new Cruisers DO NOT have independent suspension in the front.  They
still
run a straight axle, but with coils.  The 4Runner is the one with
independent
front.  The Cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system.

The 91-up Cruiser does have full time 4WD, but the center diff locks in
low range.  My brother has a 91 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which
has done all the 4+ trails in Moab without a tow.  The 93 and later is even
better with the bigger engine and locking diffs.
