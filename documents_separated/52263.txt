It is just extra wire and work to put the switch in front. Usually the easiest
place to put the switch is wherever the power cord enters the machine, and
people HATE power cords on the front!! I prefer a power strip.

Subject: StyleWriter II Dying?

I bought a StyleWriter II a couple months ago, and lately, when I print
something, I notice white lines or "gaps" running through the line being
printed.  It's almost like the paper is advancing a smidge too far when
advancing lines.  

I replaced the ink cartridge thinking it might be the problem, but the lines
are still there.  Has anyone else noticed this problem?  What's the best way to
get rid of it?
