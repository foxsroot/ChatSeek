And Fleury is no enforcer. An agitator for sure, but Fleury never has and never
will have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying Wood is. 

The closest Fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
Los Angeles. There was a scrum and McSorley pinched Fleury's head under his
arm. Fleury dropped his gloves and gave McSorley a weak shot to the side of the
head. McSorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped Fleury one right
between the eyes. End of fight. Fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.

The only player I can ever see Theo fighting is Cliff Ronning, and even then
he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)

Not always true. In fact, in the case of Doug Gilmour, he actually praises them.

Europeans that do those things are scum in Cherry's opinion. Canadian kids
that do them are "tough, just like a real Canadian". 

Ulf Samuelsson cheap shots Mark Messier's ribs and Don wants Ulf's head. Doug
Gilmour breaks Tomas Sandstrom's arm and Don says Sandstrom had it coming. 
Methinks Don is either very confused or just a bigot. Most likely the latter.

I used to like Don Cherry. I thought he was great. But I'm starting to see
his true colors (redneck) and the more I see of them, the more I think he's
just an asshole.

Matching the Makarov offer was the only real mistake Dave King has made this
year. I have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33-year old who
is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4-year $2 million contract. 
Risebrough matched the offer on King's request and Makarov has spent the last
quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain
stinks. Not to mention that he's lost a step and can no longer get himself
into position to make the nifty passes. 

I think Makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees
to pay his contract. He's ineffective in Calgary, but he might be able to help
a team like San Jose, with their shortage of talent. If there's no takers, and
Makarov doesn't show improvement in training camp, I think the Flames will just
bite the bullet and buy out Makarov's contract and release him. With his
current attitude, he is a detriment to the team.

While I agree that Lemieux deserves the Hart, it is far from a "no-brainer". 
The Hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best
player in the league. So your above arguement is really worthless. 

The Pens without Mario are still a damn good hockey team. The Leafs without 
Gilmour would have been fighting Tampa Bay for the 3rd pick. 

Like I said, Mario deserves it, IMHO. But it is a very close race and a 
Gilmour victory would not surprise me. I dislike Doug Gilmour with a passion, 
but I must concede that he is extremely valuable to the Leafs.

I think Joe Kocus should play every night.   He is a big physical guy, and  
he gets the fans into the game with some big hits.  (both checks and  
fists)  Its a big advantage to get the crowd going.  Plus, he helps  
protect the other players.  Notice there are very few fights when Kocur is  
on the ice unless he is it.  I have seen people start to go after essa  
Tikkanen, only to go slinking away when Kocur steps in.  I think he is big  
asset, but should be third line, and special situation only play.
