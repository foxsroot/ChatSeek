Before I even think about getting this, is it going to be posted to 
comp.sources.x at any time in the near future?

Subject: Re-entrancy of Xlib functions. Known problem???
From: visser@eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au (Martin Visser)

I've found a problem in the use of Xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. I
decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling
XDefineCursor from a SIG_ALRM signal handler. This is used to indicate we are
waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).
I was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring
the standard cursor when complete. I found dumped core , and upon analysis
it was when the SIG_ALRM handler was called during a XDrawString call. XDrawString
was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the XDefineCursor
was called. Presumably the (internal) structure that XDrawString was manipulating
was not in a stable state and sent XDefineCursor to where it shouldn't have been.

Has anyone else experienced this? Is there any official documentation that
says you should ensure this doesn't happen? Or should bcopy() be atomic.
We are running on SGI Irix 4.0.1 with X11R4.

Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for
*using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply
type "make" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have
to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable
Makefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile:

	#include "TeX.tmpl"
	PaperFormatA4()
	SimpleLatexTarget(document)

The generated Makefile provides the following commands:

    make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like
                    \input{somefile}

    make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file

    make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen

    make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document

    make viewps:    Display it

    make clean:     Remove unnecessary things

    make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file

    make Makefiles: Generate Makefiles in subdirectories


If ...

a) ...this seems attractive to you,
b) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report,
c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation
   (however, the German version is completed and included),

then you are invited as a beta tester. I am looking forward to your e-mail.
