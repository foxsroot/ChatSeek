From: ndacumo@eis.calstate.edu (Noah Dacumos)

My name is Noah Dacumos and I am a student at San Leandro High.  I am
doing a project for my physics class and I would like some info on the
discovery of penicillin, its discoverer(Sir Alexander Fleming), and how it
helps people with many incurable bacterias.  Also how it effects those who
are allergic to it.  Any info will be greatly appreciated.

Endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist
outside the uteris.  Sometimes this causes problems, often it doesn't.
There is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are
causing other problems.  One lady I know had Endometriosis in an ovary.  
This caused her a _great_ deal of pain.  Another lady I know has an     
endometrial cyst in her abdominal wall; she is not having it removed.

The American Fertility Society has information on this and they probably 
maintain a list of physicians in all parts of the continent that deal with
endometriosis.  You can reach them at:
