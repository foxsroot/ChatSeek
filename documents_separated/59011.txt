	I am sorry to once again bother those of you on this newsgroup. 
If you have any suggestions as to where I might find out about the subject
of this letter (the origin of Morphine, ie. who first isolsted it, and why
he/she attempted such an experiment).  Once agian any suggestion would be
appreciated.

please send me and info you think may be helpful.  Facts that you know,
but don't know what book they're from are ok.

newsgroup direct all complaints to my instructor at <bshayler@eis.CalStat.Edu>

I think a case could be made that this is discriminatory, particularly
if an applicant had good board scores and recommendations but wasn't
offered an interview, but I don't know if it has ever gone to court.
