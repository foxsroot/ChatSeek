	That I did not do; however, the sample bolt I took to the store fit
rather well in the following:  1/2" open end wrench, 1/2" box end wrench, 1/2"
12-point normal socket.  I take that as meaning it's a 1/2" bolt head.

	Yup.  At $6 a socket, I want the @#$@# thing to FIT!

Well, I waited a whole week to take the pastic bits off and take them
to the body shop.  Is that long enough :-)

I'll post a summary after I get enough information.  I'll include
tips like "how to know when the monkey is pulling your leg".  Shouldn't
monkey's have to be bonded and insured before they work on bikes?
