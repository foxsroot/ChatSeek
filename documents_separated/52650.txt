From: apland@mala.bc.ca

Heard last night that Paul Kuryia will be playing for the Canadian World
Hockey team this year.  He was on a local radio station when a friend of
the familty called to congratulate him on the invitation.  Meekly Paul told
the host that he didn't think they wanted it out yet.  This morning I heard
that he is destined to play on a line with Lindros and Recci{unsure of this
one}.  If he plays well in this arena, he could go #1 or 2 in the draft.

	You know what my answer will be: Hrivnak! The choice is obvious.

Ok, but have you seen Tabaracci play yet?  In his two starts and
his relief effort for Beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't
forget the shutout.  I think he's let in just four goals over eight
periods of play.  I like Hrivnak, but we might actually have to give
some credit to David Poile for a change after this trade.

Hopefully if Tabaracci starts against the Isles tonight, I haven't
jinxed him.
