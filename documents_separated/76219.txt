   used to arrest and sometimes to kill some of these neutral reporters.

Eh????  Could you please give me details about an event where a "Neutral
Observer" was killed by purpose by an Israeli soldier?

What gives Isreal the right to keep Jeruseleum?  It is the home of the muslim a
s well as jewish religion, among others.  Heck, nobody ever mentions what Yitza
k Shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the
 way Abdul Nidal does today.  Seems Isrealis are nowhere above Arabs, so theref
ore they have a right to Jerusaleum as much as Isreal does.
