I can't see why you would not trust it because it is safer than any previous
compression programs. It integrates into the kernal and makes it nearly
impossible to delete.

I've seen this problem several times. It was always the result of the little 
rollers inside the mouse becomming dirty- they are good at collecting grime.
the solution is simple: remove the ball to reveal the two rollers. 
Carefully clean them and the ball.
