funny, if Koresh did say that, he was quoting St. Paul. of course, 
the early Christians were persecuted too. if Koresh is a loony

     Good. Another liberal converted by Waco!  If Dave had had something
     realistic, there would have been none of this "Bradley" vehicle
     crap.

        Somebody in talk.politics.guns was offering free NRA
