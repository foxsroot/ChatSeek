Its just variation within a thread.  The variation at times has been so great
that speciation has occurred.  So Albert Sabin is the common ancestor of
several threads, some of which have themselves speciated.  On a separate topic,
I subscribed to t.o. just recently.  Albert Sabin existed at that time, so I
have no clue as to its origins.  Maybe the abiogenesists have an answer.  I
might also point out that evolution is aimless.  Thus why Albert 
Sabin evolved into a religious discussion is probably unexplainable.

Possibly the parallel just stems from your tending to use bad sources...
Anyway, don't you think that similarity is rather shallow?  You're only
looking at the surface, at the way of argumentation.  
And now you should perhaps go a little deeper and try to find the difference,
for example, find out whether you can find real science done by Hitching.
If you can't, will you then admit that your attempt at quoting an authority
has backfired?

Johannes Scotus Eriugena, the greatest European philosopher of the 9th century,
said that if reason and authority conflict, reason should be given preference.
And if that doesn't sound reasonable to you, you'll just have to accept it...
