Subject: WANGTEK Tape Controller Card Revision E - address & IRQ wanted
From: system@codewks.nacjack.gen.nz (Wayne McDougall)


I have a WANGTEK tape controller card (Revision E) that was used with the
Sytos backup system to take backups of a friend's system. That system has
crashed and I'm attempting to restore it.

Unfortunately, the documentation for this ancient card has been lost in the
mists of time, and I need to know the DMA, IRQ and address for this card.

Can anyone suggest how I could determine these things?

There is a bank of dip switches on the card which are set to:

---------------------
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
    UPUPUP    UPUPUP
UPUP      UPUP
------OPEN----------

Thanks for your time.

I always change my mind when new evidence is available. What method do you use?

	Is it possible to have 2 Sound Blasters in 1 machine?
Would give your the equivalent of a SB Pro but with stereo Digitized sound.
The way Creative Labs price Pro's in Oz, the price is equal.

	I suppose you could set the I/O addresses to 220 and 240H
but what about the DMA channels?
	Any way what is this DMA channel sharing hype?  Does it share the
SB and hardisk DMA channels or something more esoteric?
