Subject: Arythmia

I don't know if anyone knows about this topic: electrical heart 
failure. One of my friends has had to go to the doctor because
he had chest pains. The Doc said it was Arythmia. So he had to
go to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated. His
doctors said that he could die from it, and the medication caused
cancer ( that he was taking). Well, I suggested that he run, excersize
and eat more, ( he is very skinny) but he says that has nothing
to do with it. Does anyone know what causes arythmia and how 
it can be treated?
			Thanks
