Indeed Yaqouv, just like the ugly hatred spread by Kahane and
Kahanists, right?   Or they are exempt from condemnation, and allowed
to hate?

No, fool, not at all like hatred of one's sworn enemies, enemies who
have said time and again that they mean to kill you, and have, by mur-
dering innocent men, women and children, shown that they really mean it.

The late rabbi never hated anyone merely for having been born into a par-
ticular group, but he (and I) hate and would/will kill anyone who comes
to kill Jews. I recall VERY well Rabbi Kahane's words to the Iraqis at a
demonstration: "You want peace? Here is our hand (holding out an open
hand)! You don't want peace? Here is our hand (holding out a fist)!"

I know you'll answer me indirectly, it doesn't bother me a bit.
Keep it up.

Indirectly? The wonder of it is that I bother answering the likes of you
at ALL!

Subject: nobody knows his name


        I don't mean to sound disrespectful, but since the majority
of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem
to be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some 
interest to any of them.
        It's my impression that both Islam and Christianity pay great
respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from Judea/Galilee. Why 
they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery
to me (personally, I prefer Woody Allen - his stories are much juicier)
- but perhaps it's an accident of history.
        Anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different
jews. According to the New Testament his father's name was Joseph,
while in Qur'an he appears as Zachariah.  
        Who's right and why the name difference? I'm really curious.
