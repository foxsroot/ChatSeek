From: t890449@patan.fi.upm.es ()

Hi, this is my first msg to the Net (actually the 3rd copy of it, dam*ed VI!!).

  Look for the new VPIC6.0, it comes with updated VESA 1.2 drivers for almost every known card. The VESA level is 1.2, and my Tseng4000 24-bit has a nice affair with the driver. 

  Hope it is useful!!


							Bye

Subject: I need to make my VGA do shades.

I have a routine that changes the color (RGB) attributes on my
VGA adapter, but it doesn't work in the mode that I need.  
Specifically 68 hex.  An obscure mode, of course, but I need to
change the zillions of colors to 64 shade greyscale, but I do
not have the correct memory address for the pointer I need.

PLEASE, someone, I need the starting address, or maybe somewhere 
I can find it.  Thank you.
