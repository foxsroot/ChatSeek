Ed's heading out on the highway?

Did he finally buy a bike or is he a passanger?

I don't know about the dinky little Zephyr's, but the 1100 (now
the ZR1100) looks alot like my '76 Z1/ KZ900!  The one I drooled over
at Tri-Sports in Topsham, ME was a looker!

Yes, Mercury axed the Zephyr name.  Guess a lot of aging Republicans
wanted a Zephyr and confused the Mercury with the Kawasaki :).  Oh
well, they're better off with the Kawasaki anyways.  Maybe it'll shake the
stick out of their asses and  make Libertarians out of them!

As to the GPz <--> Zephyr, the only GPz I've seen had the ball-buster
gas tank profile, not the smooth saddle - to - gas tank transition.
_Motorcyclist_ claims the Zephyr / ZR is the modernized Z1 (KZ) from the
seventies.

All right people, this inane bug wibbling is just getting to much.  I
propose we split off a new group.
rec.motorcycles.nutrition 
to deal with the what to do with squashed bugs thread.

What?!?!? Haven't you heard about cross-posting??!?!? Leave it intact and
simply ignore the basenotes and/or responses which have zero interest for
a being of your stature and discriminating taste. ;-)

Yesterday, while on Lonoak Rd, a wasp hit my faceshield with just
enough force to glue it between my eyes, but not enough to kill it as
the legs were frantically wiggling away and I found that rather, shall
we say, distracting. I flicked it off and wiped off the residue at the
next gas stop in Greenfield. :-) BTW, Lonoak Rd leads from #25 into
King City although we took Metz from KC into Greenfield.
